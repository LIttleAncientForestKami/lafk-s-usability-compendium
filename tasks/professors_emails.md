# Lecture material for the class of April 6

I am appending lecture material for the class of April 6. Note that this includes a number of slides that I did not go over in the class (because of a lack of time), and it does not include some material I showed you (for example, McGurk effect) but you can find this easily over the web.

Thanks also for coming to the discussion with Prof. O'Regan. I hope you enjoyed it.

For the next class, I would like you to focus on the role of Cognitive Science in Usability. I am appending a paper of ours that we will present at CHI 2014 in Toronto on May 1st. This papers illustrates some ways of incorporating principles of cognitive science into usability design. (Our paper received best-paper-honorable-mention prize in this conference.)

Task 1: 
I am also sending you the links to CHI 2014 best papers. 
http://chi2014.acm.org/program/best-of-chi

This should give you a glimpse of the cutting edge research in the field of Computer Human Interfaces. I would like to go through this, and identify a couple of papers that interest you based on the abstracts. Then try to find out more information about those papers (for example, you can look at the home page of the authors etc.) and make a short presentation about it (6-8 slides.) We will discuss these in the class. It would be good if these papers illustrate the application of cognitive science principles to usability or interface design.

Please send me your slides before the next class on April 27.

Also, I am trying to reschedule the hands-on activity on a sunday: it will probably be May 11th. I will confirm later in the week. But regardless, we will have our usability classes on May 11, 18 and 25 at the regular time, and no class on June 8. So please mark this in your calendar and make your weekend plans appropriately.

Task 2:
In the class of April 27, you need to present your project proposal. For this you should describe the objective of your usability study and methodology.
Before you do this, please read the following material:

1. Chapter 14 of the Interaction Design book.
2. Don't Make me Think by Steve Krugg (you can easily find a soft copy in the web. If you are having trouble, send me mail and I will send you one.)

If you have any questions etc., feel free to write to me at any time.



# Tasks for the next class (April 6)

I'd like you to read Chapter 2 of Interaction Design, and do the following two tasks from it (you can again work in groupsâ€¦):

Task 1: Activities 2.7, 2.8 and 2.9 (5-6 slides)

Task 2: Assignment at the end of Chapter 2 (it could be a few slides, anywhere from 4-8)

I would also like you to read Chapters 3 and 4 from the Emotional Design book. This should be a review of what I talked about in the class today.

Task 3: Bring one example each to illustrate visceral, behavioral and reflective level of design from your everyday experience and comment on it. Also bring an example of design for fun. (So total four examples from each of you.)

Send me all the material before the morning of April 6.
