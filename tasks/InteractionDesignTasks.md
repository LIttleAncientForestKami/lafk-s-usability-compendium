              1.  **Provide examples of composite interface metaphores not mentioned in the book so far**
              2.  **Provide examples of obscurely or bizarrely named computer metaphores now being common parlances**

              3.  Examine a web browser interface and describe the various forms of analogy and composite
                  interface metaphors that have been used in its design. What familiar knowledge has been
                  combined with new functionality?

Above are activities 2.8 -  2.10 from chapter 2 of Interactive Design book. Last is done separately.

# Interface metaphores mentioned so far?

1. Search engine
2. Desktop (Star interface)
3. Scrollbar
4. Toolbar
5. Portal website
6. Lint - Unix command
7. Pipe - Unix built-in

# My own examples for interface metaphores

1. Our class website
2. Facebook website
3. World Wide Web
4. Website, Weblog, Webring
5. Wikipedia
6. E-mail

## Our class website
In Polish: Nasza Klasa, now abbreviated to nk.pl

1. Name suggest you will find your classmates there
2. It's like FaceBook, but oriented at school classes
3. Accounts are grouped per class
4. Till UX dropped down it was much more popular than FB

## Facebook

Very straightforward: 
    Book with faces and names, so you will remember

## World Wide Web

*WWW is a metaphore for Internet*


## Website, Weblog, Webring

* Web-site = site on web, or place in a web. Web, as in WWW.
* Web-log or log done on web, blog for short. Journal done on the web.
* Web-ring or ring of websites, usually linked by same theme (e.g. Tolkien MiddleEarth universe)

## Wikipedia

Coined from Wiki and -pedia, as in encyclo-pedia. 
*Wiki* is a collaboratively co-edited website, where all members can add their inputs in.
**Wikipedia** is a collaboratively created web-encyclopedia.

## E-mail

1. Electronic mail
2. No envelopes, stamps, or letter papers
3. You type letters more than pen them
4. Yet it helps with grasping programs options and eases learning

### Further driving point for e-mail?
        *Mail clients targeting older people use mail-related animations for visibility and feedback*

# Last but not least

eXtreme Programming - a software development methodology - advises one to have something called


                                                the system metaphor

Why?
* because humans like working with them
* because it frames the mindset and streamlines thinking
* because design is then conceptually consistent, which is very important for a software to be implemented

Only somewhat related to this task, but this deserves a mention, wouldn't you agree?


# Task 1 completed. Thank you, I'm eagerly awaiting your comments. Tomasz Borek.

On to task 2.

              2.  **Provide examples of obscurely or bizarrely named computer metaphores now being common parlances**

# Bizarre computer metaphores turned common parlances mentioned so far?

1. Unix lint command
2. Unix pipe built-in
3. Java - coffee-related name for a programming language
4. Bluetooth - wireless technology named after Scandinavian king Harald Blue Tooth, who united Scandinavian people


# My examples

1. Ubuntu
2. Hoisting
3. Dependency injection
4. Dropbox
5. Google

# Honourable mention

JavaScript - a browser built-in programming language, one of most (arguably THE most) popular.

Named for Java popularity and scripting. 
So a mix between 
* direct instructions what it's for (scripting) 
* and catering to name of most popular language then

And as saying goes... **Javascript is to Java what car is to carpet.**

Not fully fitting to be a bizarre metaphor turned common, but deserves a mention.


## Ubuntu

* A name of operating system family, a distribution of GNU/Linux.
* African word meaning "humanity for all".
* Ubuntu has most advanced programs for those with disabilities
* Is also one of most intuitive GNU/Linux distros to install and set up
* In installation and configuration ease it even beats Windows in number of cases

## Hoisting

* Usual programming language has block scope.
* Javascript ain't usual in that regard.
* (That surprises programmers often and makes program behaves differently than authors expected)
* JS elevates variables, treating them like declared much higher in program text than they originally were.
* This is called *hoisting*. 

### Hoisting? 

A rare word usually met in context of weight carrying, building things with heavy lifting involved 

          or man that sweeps a woman off her feet to carry her (very romantic!).

### Reaction one you hear the name in Javascript

* While usual reaction to "there's this thing in JS called hoisting" is surprise, people do get it.
* Once you know the name, you realize what surprised you and it's much easier to remember and avoid next time.

**Overall then... good, while bizarre metaphor**

## Dependency injection

* Components in software often depend on other objects or components or even systems.
* When coding, you need to mark such dependencies, to use them in your component.
* Spring framework has several mechanisms for introducing such dependencies.
* They named them *dependency injections*.
* This frames users thinking into "how I inject this dependency".
* This in turn limits the options and that's also precisely where the mechanisms work.
* While "injecting" comes from medicine, it is now quite everyday word in software engineering.


## Dropbox

* Website to store things
* Not at all intuitive, like competitor's: Private Cloud, Cloud One, Online Drive or Google Disk.
* Yet very intuitive and gathered millions of users within month from launch.
* Name alignment with way of use was many times praised.
* Service UA and UX won awards and recognitions, one could argue interface being so good was 
also influenced by the name.


## Google

* Sergey Brin and Larry Page wanted a name that would mean a really high number
* Googol was their aim, but Google was what they settled at
* Even with Google lawyers trying to protect "the brand" via Cease&Desist letters...
* "Google it!" became so common to mean "search online" that it made it's way to dictionaries.


# Task 2 completed. Thank you, I'm eagerly awaiting your comments. Tomasz Borek.

On to task 3.

              3.  Examine a web browser interface and describe the various forms of analogy and composite
                  interface metaphors that have been used in its design. What familiar knowledge has been
                  combined with new functionality?

# And...

                                                           Thank you.

                                                          **THE END**
